# CLAUDE.md — WebMelior Project Context

> Your local business, upgraded.
> Read this entire file before every task. It defines who we are, how we work, and what good output looks like.

---

## ⚡ Always do first

- **Read `PROJECTS.md`** — identify which project is being worked on and confirm the folder path before touching any file.
- **If working on a client site:** read `PLAYBOOK.md` instead of looking at the personal site files. Do NOT run `/frontend-design` — it loads WebMelior personal brand.
- **If working on the WebMelior personal site** (`clients/home-services-demo/`): confirm `PROJECT.md` is present in that folder before proceeding.
- **Invoke `/frontend-design`** before writing any frontend code on the **personal site only** — loads brand palette, screenshot workflow, logo mark, and hard rules. No exceptions.
- **Invoke `/ui-ux-pro-max`** immediately after — loads design intelligence (67 styles, 96 palettes, 57 font pairings, 99 UX guidelines, accessibility rules). Applies to all projects.
- **Check `brand_assets/`** before designing anything — it may contain logos, color guides, or style references. Use them. Do not invent brand colors or swap in placeholders where real assets exist.
- **Read this file fully** before acting on any task.

## 🖥 Frontend workflow (websites & UI)

### Output defaults
- Default output: single `index.html` with all styles inline
- Tailwind via CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- Placeholder images: `https://placehold.co/WIDTHxHEIGHT`
- Always mobile-first responsive — most local clients browse on phones

### Reference image workflow
- **If a reference image is provided:** match layout, spacing, typography, and color exactly. Use placeholder content only where real content is absent. Do NOT improve or add to the design.
- **If no reference image:** design from scratch with high craft (see anti-generic guardrails below).

### Screenshot & comparison workflow
1. Start the local server: `node serve.mjs` (background — do not start a second instance if already running)
2. Screenshot: `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000`
3. Screenshots auto-save to `./temporary screenshots/screenshot-N.png` (never overwritten)
4. Read the PNG with the Read tool and analyze it directly
5. Compare against reference — be specific: "heading is 32px but reference shows ~24px", "card gap is 16px but should be 24px"
6. Fix mismatches, re-screenshot. **Minimum 2 comparison rounds.**
7. Stop only when no visible differences remain OR user says stop
8. Check every round: spacing/padding · font size/weight/line-height · colors (exact hex) · alignment · border-radius · shadows · image sizing

### Anti-generic guardrails (no-reference builds)
- **Colors:** Never use default Tailwind palette (indigo-500, blue-600, etc.). Derive from the WebMelior brand palette or the client's brand.
- **Shadows:** Never use flat `shadow-md`. Use layered, color-tinted shadows with low opacity.
- **Typography:** Never use the same font for headings and body. Pair a display/serif with a clean sans. Apply tight tracking (`-0.03em`) on large headings, generous line-height (`1.7`) on body.
- **Gradients:** Layer multiple radial gradients. Add grain/texture via SVG noise filter for depth.
- **Animations:** Only animate `transform` and `opacity`. Use spring-style easing. Never `transition-all`.
- **Interactive states:** Every clickable element needs `hover`, `focus-visible`, and `active` states. No exceptions.
- **Images:** Add gradient overlay (`bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60`) and a color treatment layer with `mix-blend-multiply`.
- **Spacing:** Use intentional, consistent spacing tokens — not random Tailwind steps.
- **Depth:** Surfaces must have a layering system (base → elevated → floating) — not all at the same z-plane.

### Frontend hard rules
- Do not add sections, features, or content not in the reference
- Do not "improve" a reference design — match it
- Do not stop after one screenshot pass
- Do not use `transition-all`
- Do not use default Tailwind blue/indigo as primary color

## 📐 Coding standards

### General
- Write clean, readable code — client code may be handed off later
- Comment *why*, not just *what*
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains
- Wrap all API calls in `try/catch` with meaningful error messages
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets — use `.env` files always

### Naming conventions
| Type | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files | `kebab-case` | `booking-reminder.js` |
| Components | `PascalCase` | `ContactForm.jsx` |
| Variables / functions | `camelCase` | `sendFollowUp()` |
| CSS classes | `kebab-case` | `.hero-section` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRIES` |

### Git workflow
- Branch naming: `feat/description`, `fix/description`, `client/client-name`
- Commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Never commit directly to `main`
- Never commit `.env` or any file containing secrets
- One logical change per commit — don't bundle unrelated edits

## 🤖 Automation guidelines

1. **Dry-run mode first** — log what would happen before making real API calls or sending emails
2. **Rate limit all external API calls** — local business clients often have free-tier limits
3. **Log everything** to a timestamped local file — clients will ask "did it run?"
4. **Graceful failures** — if one record fails, continue with the rest and report errors at the end
5. **Plain English logs** — output should be readable by a non-technical client if needed

### Common automation patterns
- **Review request:** SMS/email 24hrs after service completion → Google review link
- **Appointment reminder:** 24hrs + 1hr before booking
- **Lead follow-up:** Auto-reply to contact form within 5 minutes
- **Monthly report:** Simple traffic + automation activity summary emailed to client

## 🎨 WebMelior brand

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary teal | `#0F6E56` |
| Light teal | `#E1F5EE` |
| Accent teal | `#9FE1CB` |
| Dark | `#2C2C2A` |
| Light bg | `#F1EFE8` |
| Font | `system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif` |

**Tone:** Friendly, clear, no jargon — knowledgeable neighbor, not tech vendor.

### Logo editing rules (`/assets/logo/`)
- Preserve viewBox and aspect ratio
- Keep the teal palette consistent — do not invent new colors
- Export both: light version (teal bg) and dark version (white bg)
- Always save a backup before editing any SVG

---

## 🧠 Behavior guidelines

- **Ask before assuming** — one clarifying question before writing code if a task is ambiguous
- **Explain changes** — briefly explain what changed and why when editing existing files
- **Suggest, don't override** — propose a better approach if you see one, but implement what was asked unless agreed otherwise
- **Confirm before destructive actions** — anything that deletes, overwrites, or deploys: ask first
- **Keep it simple** — clients are small businesses, not tech companies. Simple and working beats clever and fragile
- **No over-engineering** — a 50-line script that works beats a 500-line framework

---

## 🔐 Security (non-negotiable)

- [ ] Never log or print API keys, tokens, or passwords
- [ ] `.env` must be in `.gitignore` — never commit it
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs on contact forms
- [ ] HTTPS-only for all API endpoints
- [ ] Never store client personal data (emails, phone numbers) in plain text files
